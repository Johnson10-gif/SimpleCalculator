#  Simple Calculator – Visual Basic (.NET)

##  Project Overview

The **Simple Calculator** is a desktop application developed using **Visual Basic (.NET)** in **Visual Studio**.
It is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations in a fast, simple, and user-friendly way.
This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as event handling, user input processing, and arithmetic logic.



##  Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

* To provide a reliable tool for performing basic calculations
* To demonstrate the use of Visual Basic for Windows Forms applications
* To help beginners understand GUI programming and mathematical operations



##  Features

The calculator supports the following operations:

*  Addition
*  Subtraction
*  Multiplication
*  Division
*  Clear (Reset input)
*  Display results in real time



##  Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Visual Basic (.NET)
* **Framework:** .NET Framework / .NET
* **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio
* **Platform:** Windows Desktop (Windows Forms)


##  How the Application Works

1. The user enters two numbers using the input fields.
2. The user selects an operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, or Divide).
3. The system processes the input using arithmetic logic.
4. The result is displayed instantly on the screen.
5. The clear button resets all fields for a new calculation.



##  Importance of the Calculator to the World

The calculator plays a very important role in everyday life and global development. It is used in:

* **Education** – helping students learn and practice mathematics
* **Business** – performing financial calculations such as profit, loss, and budgeting
* **Science & Engineering** – solving equations and formulas
* **Technology** – supporting software, data analysis, and system design

This project shows how simple tools like calculators form the foundation of many modern technologies.
